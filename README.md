This exam was given 6 weeks into my journey with Coding Dojo. I had never done this type of work prior to starting this bootcamp. I am so proud of what I had learned in such a short amount of time. We were given a wireframe and told to recreate what it looked like with specific functionality and complete it within a 24 hour time period.For this exam we had to create the dropdown menu that then gave an alert of what type of pet you chose. Clicking the donate button removed the button altogether. Clicking the Pet (name of pet) button increases the number of pets for that specific pet.  I scored a 9.8 out of 10, not bad for my first try!
